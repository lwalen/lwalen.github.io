This stool was a Christmas present for my sister, who complains about being short a lot. It's made of 1 inch thick cherry, with walnut dowels.

The top is a single wide piece, but the legs are each joined up from three narrower pieces. I made sure the lighter (sapwood) edges were on the inside faces.

The hole in the top was made with a router. I made a pattern of the same size out of some 3/8" plywood, used double-sided tape to stick it to the board. Then I used a flush-trimming bit to route the slot. The advantage of doing it this was is that the pattern was thinner, so it was easier to make perfect with sandpaper and files. I can also reuse it.

Everything was just glued together with butt joints, and when that dried I drilled through both pieces and glued in dowels.

The cross-piece gives the stool most of it's rigidity. I would be nervous about the joints I did if it weren't for this piece keeping the sides from splaying and breaking the joints.

I finished the stool with a coat or two of Danish oil. Then I rubbed on paste wax when that was dry. I'm not sure if this is ideal, since it feels a bit slippery. But my sister hasn't mentioned it, so it seems to be fine.
