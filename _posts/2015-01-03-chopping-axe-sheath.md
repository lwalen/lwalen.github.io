title:  "Chopping Axe Sheath"

The plastic blade guard that came with my Fiskars chopping axe was even worse than the one for the splitter, probably because it is an older model. Plus, it looks dumb when I carry it around in the woods. So, as I did for my [splitting axe](/splitting-axe-sheath), I decided to do for my chopping axe.

This time I didn't take any pictures of making the sheath, because I got caught up making it. The construction is the same as on my splitting axe sheath. I do have pictures after finishing it though!

If you would like to make your own, I have templates!
[This PDF](/files/chopping_axe_sheath/plan.pdf)
can be printed on a piece of US Letter paper (8.5'' by 11''), and used as a template for each of the pieces, besides the strap, which is just a rectangle.
