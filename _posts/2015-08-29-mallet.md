This is the mallet I use when I need a little more delicacy than a hammer.
It has really nice proportions and weight, and has held up well.

The head came from a piece of Big Leaf Maple firewood and the handle is a piece of hard maple. The head has a square tapered hole, and the handle has the same taper. The handle can only be as wide as the narrowest part of the hole, in order to fit through. The edges of the handle are chamfered a bit to make it more comfortable.

I drilled a few holes in the block to clear out some material, then used a chisel to make it square. It took a long time, and I hope this mallet lasts a long time so I don't have to do it again.

Here is a dimensioned drawing of this mallet.
