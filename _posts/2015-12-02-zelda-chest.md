title:  "Zelda Chest"

I made this chest to look like the one in [_The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time). But instead of rupees or a hookshot, I use it like a file cabinet. It's the perfect size for manila folders.

It's made out of 3/4" pine boards (stained dark), except for the banding, which is maple (spray-painted black).
The whole thing was sprayed with satin water-based polyurethane.

Making the sides of the top was tricky. I ended up making the five sections with rougly the correct angles, and then ran the bottom part over the jointer to flatten it.

At first I wanted to replicate the look of the rivet heads on the banding, like the one in the game. Later I changed my mind, because I couldn't think of a good way to do it, and I prefer the clean look of this.
